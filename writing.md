Communcation is about bridging the gap between two minds. Clear communication is one of the greatest things there is. Taking that jumble of implicit knowledge, internal dialog and externalizing it, that is so good. And to me, the degree to which clear communication is great is directly proportional to the width of that gap separating the two communicating parties. Science talk: amazing. Science talk to non-scientists: freaking wonderful. Science talk to kids: to children: wholy holy.

This wonderment, I believe, is why I write. Here are some samples of my writing that I did for the Berkeley Science Review:
